# Sheets Directory
This directory is for local utilization of analyzer/splicer. It is hardcoded into these scripts. 
`analyzer.py` creates sub-directories here for its input. It then inserts a csv representing its findings. 
`splicer.py` then drops the trimmed video copies in the same directory as the csv.
